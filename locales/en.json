        "p1": "Witnet is a network protocol that enables independently operated computers to collaborate in retrieving and aggregating data securely, and to provide that information to smart contract systems in a tamper resistant way.",
        "p2": "These type of technologies, commonly known as \"oracles\", are one of the most important cornerstones when building smart contracts that operate on real world data. Without a reliable oracle, smart contracts can be vulnerable to hacks, corruption and monetary loss.",
        "p3": "Witnet is a next generation decentralized oracle that leverages state-of-the-art cryptographic and cryptoeconomic techniques to provide  smart contracts with secure data input."
